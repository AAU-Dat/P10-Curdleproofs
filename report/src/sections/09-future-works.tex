\section{Future work}\label{sec:future-works}
In this section we will focus on where there is still room for improvement in the Whisk protocol.

The main modification from Curdleproofs to CAAUrdleproofs is the added flexibilty in choosing the shuffle size for Whisk.
Hence, a topic to delve into in the future could be more structural modifications.
As seen in~\autoref{sec:curdleproofs-weighted-inner-product-argument-modification-attempt}, we tried this, but found that we did not have time to follow through, as it seemed that significant structural changes were needed.

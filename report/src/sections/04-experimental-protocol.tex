\todo{
    How do we simulate the attack?
    What variables do we want to control?
    Severity of attack - Slow down node or make node disappear?
}

\textit{THOUGHT (DEPRECATED): I think it would make sense to test both a slow node, and a frozen/dead node.
Linux kernel Traffic Control (tc) and Netem (part of tc) seems like the best choice for simulating network issues.}

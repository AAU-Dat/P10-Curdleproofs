\subsection{Potential mitigations}\label{subsec:potential-mitigations}
At the moment there exists an improvement proposal
to include a~\gls{ssle} mechanism, called Whisk, in Ethereum~\cite{EthereumResearchSSLE2024}.
This method aims to improve the security of the network by obfuscating the identity of the proposer.
This would make it harder
for an adversary to perform the Proposer~\gls{dos} attack since the adversary would not know which validator to target.
But even if this stops the~\gls{dos} attack, it does not prevent the de-anonymization of the validators.
But hindering a~\gls{dos} attack in itself is a good reason
to look at implementing~\gls{ssle} in Ethereum as a further step to improving the security of the network.

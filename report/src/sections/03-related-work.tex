The usage of~\glspl{zkp} in Ethereum is not a new concept.
In fact, it currently uses them both on- and off-chain.
The following provides a short overview of some of the already existing solutions as well as one still being in development.

%\subsection{Off-chain roll-ups}\label{subsec:off-chain-roll-ups}
%As a result of Ethereum's popularity, the network could easily get congested if developers were not actively trying to distribute computations~\cite{EthereumScaling2024}.

%One of the first ideas was to introduce an on-chain technique called sharding.
%It is a technique where the database would be split into different parts between subsets of validators.
%Sharding was never deployed on the blockchain though, and instead Ethereum uses off-chain solutions to off-load computations.
%The idea of off-chain solutions, called L2-roll-ups, is that users commit their work to off-chain nodes.
%These perform the computations, thereafter they submit the work to the Ethereum Mainnet chain.
%
%One of these solutions is called a~\gls{zk-rollup}.

\subsection{DoS Attack}\label{subsec:dos-attack}
Some of the instances of~\gls{dos} attacks that are seen on ethereum ranges from attacks on the proposers to attacks that seek to slow down the network itself.
A known attack aims to slow down the network by using underpriced opcodes to create a block that is hard to process~\cite{10.1145/3391195,9815256}.
Another way to slow down the network is to create empty accounts that are hard to process~\cite{empty-account-mitigation,empty-account-eip-mitigation}.
This attack, however, is outdated and has been mitigated by making it near impossible to create empty accounts in the network.

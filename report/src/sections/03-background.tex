\subsection{Zero-knowledge proofs}\label{sec:background-zkps}
Curdleproofs is a zero-knowledge proof system, which means that it allows a prover to convince a verifier that they know a secret without revealing the secret itself.
within the context of Ethereum it could be the ability to convince someone that a transaction is valid without revealing information about the transaction such as the value of it.




\subsection{Springproofs}\label{sec:background-springproofs}
Springproofs~\cite{zhang2024springproofs} is an inner product argument that aims to allow Inner Product Arguments to be more flexible by providing access to use the proof on vectors of arbitrary length.

Currently, the way to work with inner product arguments is to either only work with input sets that have the size of a power of 2, or to pad the input to the size of the next power of 2.
This leads to either forcing the prover to work with regied sizes of input sets, or to pad the input with zeros slowing down the process and forcing the prover to work with larger sets than necessary.

Springproofs is a new type of inner product argument that allows for the use of arbitrary sized input sets without the need for padding.

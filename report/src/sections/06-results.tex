After running the experiment where Curdleproofs and CAAUrdleproofs were compared across different Shuffle sizes, we obtained the results shown in \autoref{fig:resulttimes}.
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:CAAUrdleproof-experiment}, CAAUdleproofs was run with a shuffle size $k$ of $\{8,9,\dots,256\}$ but Curdleproofs was only run with a shuffle size $k$ of $\{8,16,32,64,128,256\}$.
This is why the results for Curdleproofs instantly goes up to the next size of $k$ because it would have to pad the inputset until it reaches the next size of a power of 2.
From the results, we can see that CAAUrdleproofs and Curdleproofs have similar proving and verifying times when $k$ is a power of 2 but whenever $k$ is not a power of 2 CAAUrdleproofs is faster.

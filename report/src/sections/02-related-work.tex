\subsection{Shuffling algorithm}\label{sec:related-work-Shuffling-algorithm}

The Håstad square shuffle~\cite{haastad2006square} is one of the proposed ways of integrating an~\gls{ssle}.
The Håstad square shuffle is a shuffling algorithm that shuffles a $n$ long vector with a shuffle size of $\sqrt {n}$ giving it its name.
is a more rigid version of the shuffling algorithm used in curdleproofs~\cite{cryptoeprint:2022/560}.




%The shuffling algorithm used in curdleproofs has gone though many iterations and improvements in order to increase speed and reduce the size the proof.
%This is because the proposer has a limited amount of time to propose a block in each slot, and the addition of the proof to the protocol increases the size of the block the proposers have to create.
%This is the reason why the current implementation of curdleproofs has chosen the shuffling algorithm~\cite{cryptoeprint:2022/560} proposed by Larsen et al.
%
%The way the shuffle works is by selecting 2 days' worth of proposers, and then shuffling the proposers over one day's worth of slots to create a new list of proposers for the following day.
%In each slot a subset of the proposers are shuffled, and the rest are left unchanged.
%
%Though experiments Larsen et al. has shown that after enough shuffles becomes secrue even in adversarial environments.
%They also surgests that their may be room to lower the size of the subsets chosen in each lot without losing the security of the shuffle.
%Thereby increasing the speed of the shuffle and reducing the size of the proof being added to the blockchain.

\subsection{Bulletproofs}\label{sec:related-work-bulletproofs}
A big inspiration for the curdleproofs protocol is the use of bulletproofs~\cite{bunz2018bulletproofs}.
Bulletproofs is a type of range proof that uses inner product arguments to prove that a committed value is within a certain range without revealing the value itself.
Bulletproofs is in itself not a zero-knowledge proof system, but with the help of Fiat Shamir~\cite{bunz2018bulletproofs} it can be used to create a zero-knowledge proof.
Bulletproofs also has had a few iterations and improvements to increase the speed and reduce the size of the proof since it was used in curdleproofs.
One of these is Bulletproofs+~\cite{chung2022bulletproofs+} which is a new version of bulletproof that uses a weighted inner product argument instead of the standard inner product argument to achieve a better performance.
Bulletproofs+ is also different because it is zero-knowledge proof by itself unlike the original bulletproofs.
A third version of the bulletproofs is Bulletproofs++~\cite{eagen2024bulletproofs++} which is a even newer version of bulletproofs that uses a new type of argument called the norm argument to achieve a better performance.
Unlike the two other proofs Bulletproofs++ is a binary range proof, which means that even if it is the fastest proof it is not suitable for the curdleproofs protocol due to the binary nature of the bulletproofs++.

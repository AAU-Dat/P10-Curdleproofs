After looking into Ethereum and implementing the de-anonymization attack on validators, we have found that the attack is indeed possible.
Our results reaffirm the findings of the~\gls{de-anon paper} and further highlight the Ethereum network's security issues.
The issue is that even with zero ether staked, an attacker can gain access to a lot of information about the validators in the network, most importantly their IP addresses.
This information can then be used to perform attacks on the network, such as a~\gls{dos} attack on block proposers, potentially leading to a loss of money for the honest actors within the Ethereum network.


Our research has also shown a difference in the makeup of the Holesky testnet compared to the mainnet.
The results of the de-anonymization attack on the Holesky testnet show that there are more irregular validators on the testnet compared to the mainnet.
It also shows that the amount of validators on an individual node is many times higher on the testnet than on the mainnet.
The difference is likely linked to the low risks of the Holesky testnet.
So, even though the two networks are fundamentally the same, the ecosystem within them is different, as expected.

\subsection{Ethical considerations}\label{subsec:ethical-considerations}
As the paper tackles a potential attack on the Ethereum network, it is important to consider the ethical implications of the work.
These implications are mainly related to the potential harm that could be caused by the attack.
Because of the potential harm, we have decided to not disclose the exact implementation and details of the attack, and limited the information to what is necessary to understand the attack and its implications.
This is to prevent any malicious actors from easily replicating the attack and causing harm to the mainnet.
This is also why the GitHub repository containing the code for the attack is private.
These considerations are also the reason why we only ran the attack on a testnet and not on the mainnet.
Even though running the attack on the testnet had some benefits in the form of not having to worry about the loss of any real ether and that there is a greater amount of active validators to reach, it also has some drawbacks.
The main drawback is that the testnet does not have the same restrictions for entering a validator as in the mainnet, which could affect the results of the attack.
Since you do not have to put any money in to the system to become a validator, the density of irregular validators will be higher, which could affect the results of the attack compared to the original paper, which was run on the mainnet.

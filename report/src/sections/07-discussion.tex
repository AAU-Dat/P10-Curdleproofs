In this section we will discuss the results of the experiments in \autoref{sec:results} and how they relate to the CAAUrdleproofs protocol.
We will also discuss some of the limitations of the CAAUrdleproofs protocol and how it compares to Curdleproofs.

\subsection{Shuffle Security}\label{subsec:Discution-Shuffle-security}
When looking at the results of the shuffle security experiment in \autoref{fig:shufflesecurity} and \autoref{fig:shufflesecurityviolin}, we can see that when taking into account the standard deviation, the shuffle will stil be secure with an~$\ell$ as low as 32 within the 8192 shuffles available.
Even when taking into account the worst case scenario from our experiment, the shuffle will still be secure with an~$\ell$ as low as 40 within the 8192 shuffles available.

We would however not recommend using an~$\ell$ lower than 80, as the standard deviation is still quite high at that point.

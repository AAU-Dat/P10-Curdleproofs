\subsection{Reorg}\label{subsec:reorg}
One of the reorganization attacks is \textit{Commitment Attacks on LMD GHOST}~\cite{sarenche2024breakingbalancepowercommitment}.
It works by using financial incentives to convince validators to vote for a prior block in the chain, by saying it is the block you will be commiting to, to try and exploit there laziness.
Possible because around 90\% of validators use software called "MEV Boost", which tries to earn you the most money.

Another reorg attack is Short-range reorg
